## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our project is a top priority. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in Local Web, please report it to us as soon as possible. We ask that you **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability** until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by sending an email to belisaliosmanova@gmail.com.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if applicable)
- Possible implications of the vulnerability
- Suggestions for mitigating the issue

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, here's what you can expect from us:

1. **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation**: We will promptly investigate the vulnerability and work to verify its severity and potential impact.
3. **Communication**: We will keep you informed of our progress as we work to resolve the issue. This may include asking for additional information or guidance.
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve security vulnerabilities within a reasonable timeframe. The resolution time will depend on the severity and complexity of the issue.
5. **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we will publish a security advisory detailing the issue, its impact, the fixes made, and credits to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested).

### Security Updates

We will release patches for security vulnerabilities as soon as possible and will also update the supported versions section of this document to reflect which versions have been patched.

## Security Best Practices

We also encourage our community to follow best security practices when using or contributing to Local Web. This includes keeping your systems up to date with the latest patches and being cautious with how you handle sensitive information.

Thank you for helping to keep Life AI and its users safe.
